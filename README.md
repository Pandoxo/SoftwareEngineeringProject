## 📖 Project Description

The JSON Tools Application is designed specifically for programmers who need to manipulate, analyze, and structure JSON data. Whether you need to compress large payloads, beautify unreadable strings, or compare different JSON structures side-by-side, this application provides all the necessary tools in one place. 

It is accessible via a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for manual operations and a remote API for easy integration into existing developer workflows and CI/CD pipelines.
